WP Disables Updates allow you to disables plugin or themes or wordpress core updates.

== Description ==

WP Disables Updates allow you to disables plugin or themes or translation or wordpress core updates.

Major features :

* Disable plugins updates.
* Disable themes updates.
* Disable translation updates.
* Disable Wordpress core updates.

PS: Used there features if you know what you are doing. No updates = Security holes, but sometimes updates may break your website.
WordPress has added a quite convenient feature since version 3.7: Automatic update.

But sometimes, updates can be a real problem for your website.
It is important to make updates to avoid security problems, but you must be very careful when applying updates.
For example, if you use a prenium theme and you have not made a child theme for the changes. If the theme requires an update, it may delete all your changes and lost working hours....

But be careful, it's to be used, if you know what you're doing. You have to be on the lookout for changes made to the plugins.
If a correction has been made to fill a security hole or just to improve the plugin.
